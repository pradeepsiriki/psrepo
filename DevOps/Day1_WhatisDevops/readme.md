Hello What is DevOps
======================
Devops is a process of improving the app delivery
the key things are

Improved Automation, quality , continuous Monitoring, continuous testing.

Will talk about Ci/Cd soon, not now. Let's complicate things for now.

Why is DevOps
======================

The end goal of any company is to make his/her app available for the users access it.
Different types of jobs in the process
Around 2010 the process was like this
Sys Admin: Creates server (vm), or baremetal lets say.
Build and release engineer: once the server is ready , these guys installs the binaries and middleware.
Devloper: develops the code and deploys on above servers

Downside of it: it takes lot of time to deploy / deliver any new features.
DevOps came in action only and only to improvise the process.
