server is which servers requests
ps96.com our site may be deployed on 5 physical servers of HP/IBM
lets say I gave all 5 to all teams one each,
these are the servers of 100 gb, 100 core cpu ->  later you realized that all the resources are not being used.

there comes Hypervisor ->can create vms with logical isolation, you install hypervisor on our physical server

popular hypervisors: VmWare, Xen

all virutal machines have their or cpu, memory, networking 

the same concept the cloud providers follow, create the vms out of the physical servers and serve users
